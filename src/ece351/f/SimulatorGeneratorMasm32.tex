\chapter{Simulation: \F $\rightarrow$ Assembler}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Which assembler to use?}

Options include:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textsc{masm32}. Requires a 32 bit \textsc{jdk}.

    \item \emph{MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (MARS)}. A Java
    implementation of the \textsc{risc} machine described in the
    Hennessey \& Patterson computer architecture textbook.
    \url{http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/}

\end{itemize}

\section{\textsc{masm32} Setup}

\biTight

\item Configure Eclipse to use 32-bit JDK (see prelab for instructions)

\item Install MASM32 on Windows (ideally to the default \code{C:\\masm32}).

\item Add \code{C:\\masm32\\bin} to your system path environment variable

\item Open a new command line window (to refresh path) and type "ML.EXE". It should output "Microsoft (R) Macro Assembler Version 6.14.8444...". If not, then the environment variable was not set correctly.

\subsection{Tips:}

\biTight

\item To see the JNI signatures uncomment the code for "javah" in TestSimulatorGeneratorMasm32.java; this will cause the C header to be generated. You will need to change the JDK path

\item If the batch file fails, check to see if MASM32 is on the system path and whether the directories in the batch file are correct.

\item Most of the Lab 8 code can be copied and pasted; the only difference is that for the methods, only the signature should be generated.
