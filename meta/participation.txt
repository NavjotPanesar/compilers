Document your class participation here.  You do not need to summarize
your mentorship or collaboration here, since that it already recorded
in collaboration.txt. You also do not need to report how many grace
days you didn't use here, since that is recorded in grace.txt. During
the term you will want to summarize for each week: 

- Bugs you reported in the course skeleton code.
- Patches you submitted to fix the course code.
- Test cases you contributed.
- Suggestions you made to improve the lab manual.
- Questions you answered (correctly) in the online forum.
- Practice exam questions (and answers) you contributed.
- Any other contributions of note.
